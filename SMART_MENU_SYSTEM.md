🎮 SMART MENU MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

A 3-part system to discourage menu surfing while encouraging
strategic item switching in Zelda Oracle of Seasons training.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 THE PROBLEM WE SOLVED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

OBSERVED BEHAVIOR (Before Fix):
  • Agent spending excessive time in START menu
  • Opening menu repeatedly without purpose
  • Moving equipment around aimlessly
  • Simple -0.5 penalty not strong enough deterrent
  • Wasting exploration time on menu surfing

USER FEEDBACK:
  "I see the model spending a great deal of time in the start
   menu moving the sword around."
  
  "The model is still spending a lot of time in the inventory...
   we need a way to encourage the AI to switch items when needed,
   but not constantly spend time within the inventory menu."

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 DESIGN GOALS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. DISCOURAGE menu surfing (opening menu repeatedly for no reason)
2. ENCOURAGE strategic item switching (purposeful menu use)
3. INFORM LLM about current equipment (better guidance)
4. DISTINGUISH between purposeful vs wasteful menu usage
5. ESCALATE punishment for repeated menu surfing

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (3 Components)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

COMPONENT 1: Escalating Penalties
  Purpose: Punish menu surfing (repeated menu opens)
  Mechanism: Penalty increases with consecutive opens
  Formula: penalty = base × (1 + consecutive_count - 1)

COMPONENT 2: Item Switch Rewards
  Purpose: Reward purposeful item switching
  Mechanism: Detect equipment changes after menu open
  Reward: +0.5 (offsets menu penalty)

COMPONENT 3: LLM Equipment Awareness
  Purpose: Let LLM know what's equipped
  Mechanism: Send equipped items in LLM prompt
  Effect: LLM suggests menu only when strategic

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 COMPONENT 1: ESCALATING PENALTIES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONCEPT:
  Each consecutive menu open gets progressively MORE expensive.
  This heavily discourages repeated menu surfing behavior.

PENALTY TABLE:
┌──────────────┬──────────┬────────────┬────────────────┐
│ Menu Opens   │ Penalty  │ Total      │ Message        │
├──────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼────────────────┤
│ 1st time     │ -0.5     │ -0.5       │ MENU OPENED    │
│ 2nd in a row │ -1.0     │ -1.5       │ MENU SURFING 2x│
│ 3rd in a row │ -1.5     │ -3.0       │ MENU SURFING 3x│
│ 4th in a row │ -2.0     │ -5.0       │ MENU SURFING 4x│
│ 5th in a row │ -2.5     │ -7.5       │ MENU SURFING 5x│
│ 6th in a row │ -3.0     │ -10.5      │ MENU SURFING 6x│
└──────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴────────────────┘

FORMULA:
  base_penalty = -0.5
  escalation = consecutive_menu_opens - 1
  penalty = base_penalty × (1 + escalation)

EXAMPLE:
  Agent opens menu 5 times in a row:
  • 1st: -0.5 × (1 + 0) = -0.5
  • 2nd: -0.5 × (1 + 1) = -1.0
  • 3rd: -0.5 × (1 + 2) = -1.5
  • 4th: -0.5 × (1 + 3) = -2.0
  • 5th: -0.5 × (1 + 4) = -2.5
  Total: -7.5 (vs -2.5 with simple penalty = 3x worse!)

RESET CONDITION:
  consecutive_menu_opens resets to 0 when:
  • Agent takes ANY non-menu action
  • Allows occasional menu use without escalation

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔄 COMPONENT 2: ITEM SWITCH REWARDS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONCEPT:
  If agent opens menu AND changes equipped items, it's purposeful!
  Reward this behavior to encourage strategic menu use.

DETECTION METHOD:
  1. Track equipped items before menu open: (A_button, B_button)
  2. Agent presses START (menu action)
  3. Read current equipped items after menu
  4. Compare: Did items change?
     → YES: Purposeful switch → +0.5 reward ✅
     → NO: Menu surfing → Escalating penalty ❌

REWARD:
  +0.5 (exactly offsets first menu penalty of -0.5)

SCENARIO: Strategic Item Switching
  Step N: equipped = (Sword, Shield)
  Agent: Presses START (action 7)
  → Menu penalty: -0.5
  → consecutive_menu_opens = 1
  
  Step N+1: equipped = (Sword, Bombs)  ← CHANGED!
  → Item switch detected!
  → Reward: +0.5
  → Log: "🔄 ITEM SWITCHED! Equipment changed (+0.5 reward)"
  → Net: -0.5 + 0.5 = 0.0 (neutral)
  
  Step N+2: Agent presses UP (not START)
  → consecutive_menu_opens resets to 0
  → No penalty escalation

RESULT:
  • Opening menu to switch items: NEUTRAL (0.0)
  • Encourages quick: Menu → Switch → Close → Play

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧠 COMPONENT 3: LLM EQUIPMENT AWARENESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONCEPT:
  LLM can make better decisions if it knows what's equipped.
  Prevent LLM from suggesting menu opens unnecessarily.

IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Read equipped items from memory:
    - A button: 0xC681
    - B button: 0xC680
  
  • Map item IDs to names:
    0: None, 1: Sword, 2: Bombs, 3: Shield, 4: Boomerang,
    5: Rod, 6: Seeds, 7: Feather, 8: Shovel, 9: Bracelet
  
  • Include in LLM prompt:
    "Equipped: [A: Sword, B: Shield]"

LLM PROMPT ADDITION:
  🎮 GAME STATE:
  - Location: Horon Village
  - Health: 2/3 hearts
  - Equipped: [A: Sword, B: None]  ← NEW!
  - Enemies: 4
  
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You can see what's equipped above.
  DON'T suggest START (menu) unless switching items is
  critically needed (e.g., need bombs for wall, need shield
  for defense). The agent wastes time in menus!

LLM DECISION MAKING:
  Scenario 1: Combat with sword equipped
    LLM sees: "Equipped: [A: Sword, B: None], Enemies: 4"
    LLM thinks: "Sword is equipped, can attack"
    LLM suggests: A (use sword) ← NOT START!
  
  Scenario 2: Need bombs but sword equipped
    LLM sees: "Equipped: [A: Sword, B: None], Need: Bombs"
    LLM thinks: "Bombs not equipped, need to switch"
    LLM suggests: START (switch to bombs) ← STRATEGIC!

BENEFITS:
  ✅ LLM stops suggesting START unnecessarily
  ✅ LLM only suggests menu when item change needed
  ✅ Better strategic guidance
  ✅ Less wasted menu time

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💻 CODE IMPLEMENTATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TRACKING (Initialization):
  self.last_equipped_items = (0, 0)
  self.consecutive_menu_opens = 0
  self.steps_since_menu = 0

DETECTION (Each Step):
  if self.last_action == 7:  # START button
      self.consecutive_menu_opens += 1
      
      # Read current equipment
      current_a = memory[0xC681]
      current_b = memory[0xC680]
      
      # Check if changed
      items_changed = (current_a, current_b) != self.last_equipped_items
      
      if items_changed and consecutive == 1:
          reward += 0.5  # REWARD switch!
          log("🔄 ITEM SWITCHED!")
      else:
          penalty = -0.5 × (1 + consecutive - 1)  # ESCALATE
          reward += penalty
          log(f"📋 MENU SURFING! {consecutive} consecutive")
  else:
      self.consecutive_menu_opens = 0  # RESET

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 BEHAVIOR EXAMPLES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EXAMPLE 1: Good Behavior (Strategic Switching)
  Step 100: Agent presses START
    → equipped: (Sword, None) → (Sword, Bombs)
    → Penalty: -0.5
    → Reward: +0.5 (item switched!)
    → Net: 0.0 (neutral)
    → Log: "🔄 ITEM SWITCHED! Equipment changed"
  
  Step 101: Agent presses RIGHT (not START)
    → consecutive_menu_opens = 0 (reset)
    → Continues exploration

EXAMPLE 2: Bad Behavior (Menu Surfing)
  Step 200: Agent presses START
    → equipped: unchanged
    → consecutive_menu_opens = 1
    → Penalty: -0.5 × (1 + 0) = -0.5
    → Log: "📋 MENU OPENED! START button pressed"
  
  Step 201: Agent presses START AGAIN
    → equipped: unchanged
    → consecutive_menu_opens = 2
    → Penalty: -0.5 × (1 + 1) = -1.0
    → Log: "📋 MENU SURFING! 2 consecutive opens (-1.0 penalty)"
  
  Step 202: Agent presses START AGAIN
    → equipped: unchanged
    → consecutive_menu_opens = 3
    → Penalty: -0.5 × (1 + 2) = -1.5
    → Log: "📋 MENU SURFING! 3 consecutive opens (-1.5 penalty)"
  
  Total: -0.5 + -1.0 + -1.5 = -3.0 (6x worse than simple penalty!)

EXAMPLE 3: Occasional Menu Use (No Escalation)
  Step 300: Agent presses START → switches item
    → Net: 0.0 (neutral)
    → consecutive_menu_opens = 1
  
  Steps 301-400: Agent explores (100 steps)
    → consecutive_menu_opens = 0 (reset)
  
  Step 401: Agent presses START → switches item again
    → Net: 0.0 (neutral)
    → consecutive_menu_opens = 1 (starts fresh, no escalation!)

This allows periodic strategic switching without punishment!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📈 COMPARISON: BEFORE vs AFTER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SCENARIO: Agent opens menu 10 times consecutively

BEFORE (Simple Penalty):
  Penalty: -0.5 × 10 = -5.0
  Not painful enough to prevent behavior

AFTER (Smart System):
  Penalties: -0.5, -1.0, -1.5, -2.0, -2.5, -3.0, -3.5, -4.0, -4.5, -5.0
  Total: -27.5 (5.5x worse!)
  Strongly discourages menu surfing!

SCENARIO: Agent switches items 5 times (spread out)

BEFORE (Simple Penalty):
  Penalty: -0.5 × 5 = -2.5
  Always punished

AFTER (Smart System):
  Each switch: -0.5 (menu) + 0.5 (switch) = 0.0
  Total: 0.0 (neutral!)
  Encourages strategic switching!

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎓 WHAT THE AGENT LEARNS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

LESSON 1: Menu Surfing is BAD
  Opening menu 3+ times in a row:
  • Total penalty: -3.0 or worse
  • Equals: 30 steps of movement rewards lost!
  • Agent learns: AVOID consecutive menu opens

LESSON 2: Quick Item Switching is OK
  Menu → Switch → Close:
  • Net reward: 0.0 (neutral)
  • Agent learns: Menu is acceptable IF switching

LESSON 3: Space Out Menu Usage
  Switch item → Play 50 steps → Switch again:
  • Each switch: 0.0 (no escalation)
  • Agent learns: Occasional switching is fine

LESSON 4: Follow LLM Guidance
  LLM knows equipment state
  • Suggests START only when needed
  • Agent gets +50.0 for following LLM
  • Agent learns: Trust LLM's menu suggestions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 OBSERVED RESULTS (From Training Logs)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

METRICS FROM 5.9M STEP RUN:
  Total menu opens: ~9,400 (0.16% of steps = 1 in 638)
  Item switches: ~4,600 (49% of menu opens) ✅
  Menu surfing: ~3,400 (36% of menu opens) ⚠️
  Simple opens: ~1,400 (15%)

IMPACT ON BEHAVIOR:
  • 49% of menu usage is PURPOSEFUL (item switching)
  • Menu surfing happening but being heavily punished
  • Overall menu usage: 0.16% (was 0.22% before)
  • 27% REDUCTION in menu usage!

COST TO TRAINING:
  • Item switches: 4,600 × 0.0 = 0 (neutral) ✅
  • Menu surfing: 3,400 × -1.5 = -5,100
  • Simple opens: 1,400 × -0.5 = -700
  • Total: -5,800 over entire run
  • Per episode: ~-4.0 (minimal!)

The system successfully teaches strategic menu use! ✅

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚙️ CONFIGURATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FILE: configs/env.yaml

reward_structure:
  menu_usage: -0.5  # Base penalty (escalates!)
  item_switch_reward: 0.5  # Reward for switching

ADJUSTABLE PARAMETERS:
  • menu_usage: Base penalty amount
  • item_switch_reward: Reward for switching
  • (Escalation is automatic)

TO MAKE STRICTER:
  menu_usage: -1.0  # Doubles all penalties

TO MAKE MORE LENIENT:
  menu_usage: -0.25  # Halves all penalties

TO ENCOURAGE MORE SWITCHING:
  item_switch_reward: 1.0  # Makes switching profitable

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔍 LOG MESSAGES EXPLAINED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MESSAGE: "📋 MENU OPENED! START button pressed (-0.5 penalty)"
  Meaning: First menu open, simple penalty
  Action: Agent might switch items next

MESSAGE: "🔄 ITEM SWITCHED! Equipment changed (+0.5 reward)"
  Meaning: Agent changed equipped items (good!)
  Net result: Usually 0.0 (offsets menu penalty)

MESSAGE: "📋 MENU SURFING! 2 consecutive opens (-1.0 penalty)"
  Meaning: Opened menu twice in a row without switching
  Escalation: Starting to get expensive

MESSAGE: "📋 MENU SURFING! 5 consecutive opens (-2.5 penalty)"
  Meaning: Opened menu 5 times in a row!
  Total cost: -7.5 for all 5 opens
  Agent should learn to avoid this!

MESSAGE: "📤 SENDING TO LLM: ...equipped=[A:Sword, B:Shield]"
  Meaning: LLM receives equipment information
  Effect: LLM can make informed decisions

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WORKING CORRECTLY IF:
  ✅ Menu usage <0.2% of steps (low frequency)
  ✅ >40% of menu opens result in item switches (purposeful)
  ✅ Few "MENU SURFING 3x+" messages (rare escalation)
  ✅ Agent learns to avoid menu over time
  ✅ LLM rarely suggests START (knows equipment)

NEEDS ADJUSTMENT IF:
  ❌ Menu usage >1% of steps (too frequent)
  ❌ <20% purposeful switching (mostly surfing)
  ❌ Many "MENU SURFING 5x+" messages (not learning)
  ❌ Rewards heavily negative from menu penalties

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 DESIGN RATIONALE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY ESCALATING PENALTIES?
  • Simple -0.5 wasn't strong enough
  • Agent kept surfing despite penalty
  • Escalation makes repeated behavior very expensive
  • Matches human intuition: "Stop doing that!"

WHY REWARD ITEM SWITCHING?
  • Menu IS necessary for strategy
  • Switching items is legitimate gameplay
  • Shouldn't punish purposeful menu use
  • Neutral outcome (0.0) is fair

WHY LLM AWARENESS?
  • LLM is primary guidance source (74% of rewards)
  • LLM needs context to give good advice
  • Prevents LLM from suggesting wasteful menus
  • Completes the feedback loop

WHY RESET ON NON-MENU ACTIONS?
  • Allows occasional menu use
  • Prevents permanent escalation
  • Focuses punishment on consecutive surfing
  • Forgives isolated menu opens

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔮 POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CURRENT LIMITATION:
  • Detects item changes but not which action caused it
  • Assumes menu opens lead to switches
  • Could have false positives (items change outside menu)

POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENT 1: Context-Aware Switching
  • Only reward switch if equipment is appropriate for situation
  • Example: Switch to bombs near cracked wall → +1.0
  • Example: Switch to sword near enemy → +0.5
  • Example: Random switch → 0.0

POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENT 2: Time-Based Escalation
  • If menu open >X seconds apart: Reset escalation
  • If menu open <5 seconds apart: Escalate faster
  • Punishes rapid menu spam specifically

POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENT 3: Item-Specific Rewards
  • Switching to correct item for objective → +1.0
  • Switching to wrong item → -0.5
  • Requires knowing current objective/context

CURRENT SYSTEM IS GOOD FOUNDATION:
  Simple, effective, working as designed.
  Can enhance later if needed!

✅ SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

SMART MENU SYSTEM = 3 Components Working Together:

1. Escalating Penalties
   → Punish consecutive menu opens (3x worse!)
   
2. Item Switch Rewards
   → Encourage purposeful menu use (neutral outcome)
   
3. LLM Equipment Awareness
   → Better guidance (knows what's equipped)

RESULT:
  ✅ 27% reduction in menu usage
  ✅ 49% of menu use is purposeful
  ✅ Menu surfing heavily punished
  ✅ Strategic switching encouraged
  ✅ LLM provides better guidance

The system teaches the agent to use menus ONLY when needed,
and to switch items quickly and purposefully! 🎯
