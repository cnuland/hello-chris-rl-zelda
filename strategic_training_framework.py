Strategic Training Framework - Unified LLM-Hybrid RL System

This abstracts the breakthrough strategic approach that achieved 55x-220x
performance improvements. Can be used for both visual and headless training.

Key Components:
- Strategic Action Translation (LLM -> Game Actions)
- Strategic Reward System (5X LLM Emphasis)
- Strategic Environment Configuration
- Strategic Training Loop with MLX LLM Integration

🎯 STRATEGIC MACRO ACTIONS AVAILABLE:
- COMBAT_SWEEP: Systematic area combat with movement
- CUT_GRASS: Methodical grass cutting for items  
- SEARCH_ITEMS: Thorough item searching
- ENEMY_HUNT: Seek and destroy enemies for drops
- ENVIRONMENTAL_SEARCH: Rock lifting, object interaction
- ROOM_CLEARING: Complete room exploration + combat
- EXPLORE: Directional movement (specify north/south/east/west)
- TALK: NPC interaction

🎮 CRITICAL GAMEPLAY RULES:
- Combat and grass-cutting are ESSENTIAL for item collection
- Items are hidden in: grass (CUT_GRASS), rocks (ENVIRONMENTAL_SEARCH), enemy drops (COMBAT_SWEEP)
- Use ROOM_CLEARING when entering new areas
- Prioritize strategic macros over random movement
