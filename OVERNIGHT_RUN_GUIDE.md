# 🌙 Overnight Training Run - Next Steps Guide

**Current Job**: `raysubmit_iAkbELhTrRWYuLA2`  
**Started**: October 16, 2025 ~6:05 PM  
**Status When Left**: Iteration 396, +7,734 rewards, 10,000 step episodes  

---

## 📊 When You Return - Check These Metrics

### 1. Get Final Training Status

```bash
# Check if job is still running
oc exec zelda-rl-head-s9rdj -- ray job list | grep "raysubmit_iAkbELhTrRWYuLA2"

# Get final iteration and metrics
oc exec zelda-rl-head-s9rdj -- ray job logs raysubmit_iAkbELhTrRWYuLA2 | tail -1000 | grep -E "iteration.*finished|episode_return_mean|episode_len_mean" | tail -20
```

### 2. Find Best Checkpoint

**Metrics to Look For:**
- **Highest `episode_return_mean`** (best overall performance)
- **Stable `episode_len_mean`** (consistent 10,000 = mastered survival)
- **Iteration number** (later = more trained)

**Example Output:**
```
Trial finished iteration 500. Total running time: 8hr 15min
│ env_runners/episode_return_mean    9234.56 │  ← LOOK FOR HIGHEST!
│ env_runners/episode_len_mean        10000  │  ← Should be 10,000
```

**Best checkpoint**: Iteration with **highest return** + **stable 10k length**

---

## 🎯 How to Identify the Best Checkpoint

### Method 1: From Logs (Recommended)

```bash
# Extract all iteration results
oc exec zelda-rl-head-s9rdj -- ray job logs raysubmit_iAkbELhTrRWYuLA2 | \
  grep -E "iteration.*finished|episode_return_mean" | \
  grep -A1 "finished iteration" | \
  tail -100
```

Look for:
- **Peak `episode_return_mean`** (e.g., 9,500+)
- Iteration number where this occurred

### Method 2: From Ray Dashboard

1. Open Ray Dashboard (URL from notebook Cell 11)
2. Navigate to **Jobs** → `raysubmit_iAkbELhTrRWYuLA2`
3. Click **"Training Metrics"** tab
4. Find iteration with highest `episode_return_mean`
5. Note the iteration number

### Method 3: Look for Plateau

If rewards plateaued (e.g., stable at +8,000 for 50+ iterations), pick a checkpoint from the plateau region:
- Avoids early unstable iterations
- Avoids potential overfitting at very late iterations
- Stable performance

---

## 📈 Expected Overnight Progress

**Starting Point** (Iteration 396):
- Episode return: +7,734
- Episode length: 10,000 (maxed)
- Runtime: 5 hours

**Estimated Overnight** (assuming 10-12 hours total):
- Final iteration: ~800-1,000
- Episode return: +8,000-10,000 (plateau likely)
- Episode length: 10,000 (should stay maxed)

**Learning Curve Prediction:**
- Iterations 396-500: Continued improvement (+7,734 → +8,500)
- Iterations 500-800: Plateau (stable ~+8,500-9,000)
- Iterations 800+: May overfit or stay stable

**Best checkpoint likely in**: Iterations 500-700 (plateau region)

---

## 🔍 Checkpoint Selection Criteria

### Scenario 1: Peak Performance

**Goal**: Best absolute performance  
**Metric**: Highest `episode_return_mean`  
**Selection**: Iteration with maximum reward (e.g., +9,234)

### Scenario 2: Stable Performance

**Goal**: Consistent, reliable behavior  
**Metric**: Stable plateau (e.g., +8,500 for 50+ iters)  
**Selection**: Middle of plateau region (e.g., iteration 600)

### Scenario 3: Fast Iteration

**Goal**: Quick experiments with decent policy  
**Metric**: Good performance, earlier checkpoint  
**Selection**: Iteration 400-500 (+8,000 rewards, faster to load)

**Recommendation**: **Scenario 2** (stable plateau) is best for future experiments!

## 📋 What to Do Next Morning

### Step 1: Check Final Results

```bash
# Get final metrics
oc exec zelda-rl-head-s9rdj -- ray job logs raysubmit_iAkbELhTrRWYuLA2 | \
  tail -100 | grep "episode_return_mean"
```

### Step 2: Identify Best Checkpoint

Look for iteration with **highest return** or **stable plateau**.

Example:
```
Iteration 650: episode_return_mean = 8,945.23  ← BEST!
```

### Step 3: Note Checkpoint Path

Ray checkpoints are in:
```
/tmp/ray/session_2025-10-16_19-21-03_xxx/PPO_ZeldaOracleSeasons/PPO_zelda_env_4166c_00000/checkpoint_000650
```

### Step 4: Document the Checkpoint

Create a note with:
- **Checkpoint path**: `/tmp/ray/.../checkpoint_000650`
- **Iteration**: 650
- **Performance**: +8,945 rewards, 10,000 steps
- **Config used**:
  - Workers: 5
  - LLM text: 2%, vision: 3%
  - Room discovery: 20.0
  - Movement: 0.1
  - Smart menu: Enabled
  - Stuck penalty: Disabled (Y-bug)

## 🚀 Using the Checkpoint for Future Runs

### Example: Add Dungeon Entry Rewards

**Pull latest code:**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

**Update notebook (Cell 11):**
```python
env_vars = {
    # ... keep all settings ...
    
    # Add checkpoint restoration:
    'RESTORE_CHECKPOINT': '/tmp/ray/.../checkpoint_000650',  # ← Your best checkpoint
}
```

**Update configs/env.yaml:**
```yaml
# Add new rewards:
reward_structure:
  # ... existing rewards ...
  dungeon_entered: 200.0  # NEW! Reward for finding dungeons
  sword_obtained: 300.0   # NEW! Reward for getting better sword
```

**Deploy:**
- Restart Jupyter kernel
- Run Cell 11 + Cell 14

**Result:**
- Starts from iteration 650 (not 0!)
- Keeps exploration skills
- Learns new dungeon objective
- Faster iteration (builds on existing knowledge)

## ⚠️ Potential Issues to Check

### Issue 1: Job Stopped Early

**Check**: Job status (RUNNING, STOPPED, or FAILED)
```bash
oc exec zelda-rl-head-s9rdj -- ray job list | grep iAkbELhTrRWYuLA2
```

**If STOPPED**: Check last iteration, use that checkpoint  
**If FAILED**: Check logs for error, may need to fix and restart  
**If RUNNING**: Great! Let it continue or stop when satisfied

### Issue 2: Rewards Decreasing

**Symptom**: `episode_return_mean` going down after iteration 500+

**Possible Causes**:
- Overfitting (too much training)
- Agent found exploit in reward system
- Checkpoint corruption

**Solution**: Use earlier checkpoint (iteration 400-500)

### Issue 3: Episode Length Dropping

**Symptom**: `episode_len_mean` drops from 10,000 to lower

**Possible Causes**:
- Agent learned to die faster (negative reward for something)
- Death penalty may need adjustment
- New enemy behavior

**Solution**: Check what changed, use stable checkpoint

## 🎯 Recommended Next Experiments

After selecting best checkpoint, try these in order:

### Experiment 1: Dungeon Entry Focus (Conservative)

```python
# Restore from best checkpoint
'RESTORE_CHECKPOINT': '/tmp/ray/.../checkpoint_000{best}',

# In env.yaml, add:
dungeon_entered: 200.0  # Reward for entering dungeons
```

**Expected**: +200 per dungeon → +9,000+ total rewards

### Experiment 2: Maku Tree Milestone Validation

```python
# Restore from best checkpoint

# In env.yaml, keep:
maku_tree_visited: 100.0  # Already configured
```

**Check logs for**: "🌳 MILESTONE: Maku Tree Entered!"  
**Expected**: +100 bonus when milestone triggers

### Experiment 3: Combat Engagement

```python
# Restore from best checkpoint

# In env.yaml, add:
enemy_defeat_reward: 5.0  # Reward for defeating enemies
```

**Expected**: Agent learns combat instead of just avoidance

### Experiment 4: Scale to Production

```python
# Restore from best checkpoint

'RAY_WORKERS': '25',  # Scale up from 5
'ENVS_PER_WORKER': '12',  # Scale up from 6
'BATCH_SIZE': '16384',  # Scale up from 4096
```

**Expected**: 10x faster training throughput
