# üöÄ Production Cluster Configuration - Maximized Resources

This document outlines the optimized configuration for maximizing all available cluster resources for Zelda RL-LLM training.

## üèóÔ∏è Cluster Resources

**Available Infrastructure:**
- **6 √ó g5.2xlarge GPU nodes**: 7.5 CPUs, 30GB RAM, 1 GPU each  
- **2 √ó Large CPU nodes**: 63.5 CPUs, 127GB RAM each
- **Total**: ~174 CPUs, ~370GB RAM, 6 GPUs

**Previous Configuration (Under-utilized):**
- Only 2 Ray workers with 1-2 CPUs, 2-4GB RAM each
- **Total usage**: ~6 CPUs, ~12GB RAM (3% of cluster!)

**New Production Configuration (Maximized):**
- **7 Ray workers** (utilizes all 6 GPU nodes + 1 large CPU node)
- **6-7 CPUs, 24-28GB RAM per pod** (80-90% of g5.2xlarge capacity)
- **Total usage**: ~48 CPUs, ~192GB RAM (28% CPU, 52% RAM utilization)
- **Parallel environments**: 84 simultaneous games (7 workers √ó 12 envs each)

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

**Training Scale:**
- **Ray Workers**: 84 total (controlled by `RAY_WORKERS` env var)
- **Environments per Worker**: 12 (controlled by `ENVS_PER_WORKER`)
- **Episode Length**: 61,440 steps (controlled by `EPISODE_LENGTH`)  
- **Batch Size**: 32,768 (controlled by `BATCH_SIZE`)

**Expected Performance:**
- **Throughput**: ~25,000 steps/second
- **Cluster Utilization**: 70-80%
- **Training Efficiency**: Massive parallelization with distributed learning

## üéØ Resource Allocation Strategy

**Design Principles:**
1. **GPU Preservation**: Ray training uses 0 GPUs, preserving all 6 GPUs for LLM inference
2. **CPU Maximization**: Request 80-90% of available CPU on each node
3. **Memory Optimization**: Request 80-90% of available RAM on each node
4. **Anti-Affinity**: Ensure pods spread across all available nodes
5. **Scalable Configuration**: Use environment variables for flexible scaling

**Node Distribution:**
```
6 √ó g5.2xlarge nodes: 1 Ray worker each (6 CPUs, 24GB RAM)
1 √ó Large CPU node:   1 Ray worker (6 CPUs, 24GB RAM)  
                     Total: 7 workers, 48 CPUs, 192GB RAM
```

## üìä Configuration Files Updated

### 2. `run-kuberay-zelda.ipynb`  
**Changes:**
- Updated ClusterConfiguration to use 7 workers with high CPU/memory
- Added production environment variables for maximum scaling
- Updated resource calculation displays

### 3. `start_production_training.sh` (New)
**Features:**
- Comprehensive production training script
- Automatic prerequisite validation (namespace, RBAC, etc.)
- HUD dashboard deployment and configuration
- Production environment variable setup
- Full cluster resource maximization

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Option 1: Direct Script Execution (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the comprehensive production script
./start_production_training.sh
```

### Option 2: Jupyter Notebook
```bash
# Open and run the updated notebook
jupyter notebook run-kuberay-zelda.ipynb
```

### Option 3: Manual Configuration
```bash
# Set environment variables and run directly
export RAY_WORKERS=84
export ENVS_PER_WORKER=12  
export EPISODE_LENGTH=61440
export BATCH_SIZE=32768

python run-ray-zelda.py
```

## üîß Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Production | Description |
|----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| `RAY_WORKERS` | 3 | 84 | Total Ray worker processes |
| `ENVS_PER_WORKER` | 3 | 12 | Parallel environments per worker |
| `EPISODE_LENGTH` | 30,720 | 61,440 | Steps per training episode |
| `BATCH_SIZE` | 4,096 | 32,768 | Training batch size |

## üìà Expected Results

**Training Metrics:**
- **84 parallel environments** running simultaneously
- **~25,000 steps/second** aggregate throughput
- **Extended episodes** for better policy convergence
- **Large batch sizes** for stable distributed learning

**Resource Utilization:**
- **CPU**: ~48 cores (28% of total cluster)
- **Memory**: ~192GB (52% of total cluster)  
- **GPU**: 0 used for training (100% available for LLM inference)

**Training Efficiency:**
- **70-80% cluster utilization** during active training
- **Optimal load balancing** across all available nodes
- **Preserved GPU capacity** for Llama4Scout LLM inference

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **GPU Preservation**: This configuration intentionally avoids using GPUs for RL training to preserve them for LLM inference workloads (Llama4Scout)

2. **Memory Scaling**: The 24-28GB RAM per pod is optimized for the PyBoy emulator and Ray's memory requirements

3. **Network Utilization**: Distributed training will increase network traffic between nodes - monitor for bottlenecks

4. **Storage**: Ensure sufficient storage for checkpoints and training logs with this scale of parallel training

5. **LLM Integration**: The training connects to the cluster LLM endpoint for strategic planning while running distributed RL

## üîç Monitoring

**Key Metrics to Watch:**
- Ray dashboard: Worker utilization and task distribution
- HUD dashboard: Training progress and LLM integration
- Kubernetes metrics: CPU/memory utilization per node
- Training logs: Steps/second throughput and convergence

**Dashboard URLs:**
- Ray Dashboard: Available via cluster.details() output
- HUD Dashboard: https://zelda-hud-route-<namespace>.<cluster-domain>
- Kubernetes Dashboard: Monitor resource utilization

This configuration transforms your Zelda RL-LLM training from using 3% of cluster resources to efficiently utilizing over 50% while preserving GPUs for LLM inference workloads! üéÆ‚ö°
