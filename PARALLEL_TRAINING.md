    def __init__(self, env_id: int, rom_path: str, episode_length: int)
    def initialize(self)  # Create PyBoy instance

```

### Parallel Training Loop
- **Environment Coordination**: Manages multiple PyBoy instances

- **Resource Utilization**: Better CPU/GPU utilization
- **Pipeline Efficiency**: Overlapped computation and game execution
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient matrix operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Best Practices

### Environment Scaling
- **Start Small**: Begin with 2 environments, scale up gradually
- **Monitor Resources**: Watch CPU/memory usage with more environments
- **Balance Load**: More environments ‚â† always better (diminishing returns)

### Training Configuration
- **Episode Length**: Longer episodes (750-1000) work better for parallel training
- **Batch Size**: Scale batch size with number of environments
- **Update Epochs**: More epochs (6-8) benefit from larger batches

### Performance Monitoring
- **Steps per Second**: Monitor overall throughput
- **Episodes per Second**: Track episode completion rate
- **Memory Usage**: Watch for memory leaks with multiple PyBoy instances

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Memory Usage**: Each PyBoy instance uses ~50MB RAM
- **PyBoy Limits**: SDL may limit simultaneous instances  
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: More environments may saturate CPU/disk I/O

### Solutions
- **Resource Monitoring**: Use system monitoring tools
- **Gradual Scaling**: Start with 2 envs, increase slowly
- **Error Handling**: Robust cleanup and error recovery

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Scale Testing**: Test with 4-8 parallel environments
2. **Performance Profiling**: Identify bottlenecks and optimize
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize batch size, epochs, episode length

### Advanced Features  
1. **Asynchronous Training**: True async environment execution
2. **Distributed Training**: Multi-machine parallel training
3. **Mixed Training**: Combine parallel pure RL with LLM guidance
4. **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatic environment count adjustment
