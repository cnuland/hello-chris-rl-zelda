  üö® EARLY GAME STATUS: LINK HAS NO SWORD YET!
  
  EARLY GAME STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (IN ORDER):
  1. ü´Ä SURVIVAL: If health ‚â§ 1, use AVOID_ENEMIES to retreat from danger - you can't fight effectively yet!
  2. üèòÔ∏è GO_SOUTH: Primary objective - head SOUTH to Horon Village (NOT north!)
  3. üí¨ TALK_TO_NPC: Talk to villagers in Horon Village for directions to the Maku Tree
  4. üö™ GO_IN_HOUSE: Enter houses in village to get quest info and directions
  5. üå≥ GO_EAST: From village, head EAST to find the Maku Tree (not directly north from start!)
  6. üó°Ô∏è Get Wooden Sword from Maku Tree (enables combat and grass cutting)
  7. üîç SEARCH_AREA: Examine areas safely for items and clues
  8. üõ°Ô∏è Return to starting area with sword to begin main quest
  
  üéØ CRITICAL EARLY GAME RULES:
  - Use GO_SOUTH as your primary navigation - head to Horon Village first (NOT north!)
  - North is blocked by river/bushes you can't cut - avoid GO_NORTH until you have sword
  - Use TALK_TO_NPC in village for crucial directions to the Maku Tree
  - Use GO_IN_HOUSE to enter village buildings and talk to NPCs for guidance
  - From village, use GO_EAST to reach the Maku Tree (not directly from start area)
  - Use SEARCH_AREA to safely examine locations for items and clues without combat
  - NEVER use USE_ITEM_SWORD without actually having the sword - you'll just swing at air
  - Use AVOID_ENEMIES instead of engaging in combat - they're too dangerous for unarmed Link
  - Save USE_ITEM_SWORD and combat actions for AFTER you acquire the sword

  EXECUTION GUIDELINES:
  - Generate 1-3 macro actions maximum per plan (don't over-plan)
  - Use exact coordinates from entities data when targeting items/enemies
  - Consider Link's current equipment and capabilities
  - Factor in seasonal requirements for obstacles
  - Prioritize actions based on immediate needs vs long-term goals
  - If health is critical (‚â§1 heart), focus exclusively on survival
  - Use the llm_prompt field for quick situation assessment

  RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:
  - MUST return valid JSON (no extra text before/after)
  - Include all required fields: subgoal, reasoning, macros
  - Each macro must have: action_type, parameters, priority, expected_duration
  - Priority values: 1.0 = highest, 0.1 = lowest
  - Expected_duration: estimated frames to complete (20-100 typical)
  - Reasoning should be concise but explain the strategic value

  ERROR HANDLING:
  If you cannot determine a good action, default to:
  {
    "subgoal": "Explore and assess situation", 
    "reasoning": "Insufficient information to determine optimal strategy, exploring to gather more data",
    "macros": [{"action_type": "EXPLORE_ROOM", "parameters": {"radius": 3}, "priority": 0.8, "expected_duration": 60}]
  }

  Analyze the situation and provide your strategic plan. Focus on the llm_prompt field for quick assessment, then use entity positions for precise targeting.

  Respond with JSON only - no additional text.
