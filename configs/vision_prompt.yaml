  - Link (the player character) appears as a small sprite on screen
  - NPCs (non-player characters) are stationary or moving characters to interact with
  - Enemies are hostile creatures that damage Link when touched
  - Items appear as small objects that can be collected
  - Terrain includes grass, water, trees, rocks, and pathways
  - Health is shown in the top-left corner as hearts
  
  VISUAL ELEMENTS TO RECOGNIZE:
  - Link: Small character sprite (usually green tunic)
  - NPCs: Stationary characters (often in villages/houses)
  - Enemies: Moving hostile sprites
  - Doors/Entrances: Dark rectangles at screen edges
  - Items: Small glowing or distinct objects on ground
  - Obstacles: Trees, rocks, water that block movement
  - UI: Hearts (health) in top-left, item slots in corners

  ‚úÖ Link already has the Wooden Sword (equipped to B button)
  üìç Starting location: Horon Village entrance (southern area with kids playing)
     - Near the flower that launches kids to hilltop in Spring
     - At the entrance/edge of Horon Village
  
  üìç OBJECTIVE 1: REACH THE MAKU TREE GROVE (CURRENT TOP PRIORITY!)
     Location: Maku Tree grove is EAST of Horon Village
     
     Path from starting location:
     1. From village entrance: Navigate through village going EAST
     2. Find the shop (near Know-It-All Birds hut) - optional: buy shield for 30 rupees
     3. Continue EAST toward Vasu Jewelers
     4. Keep going EAST to reach the Maku Tree grove area
     5. You'll reach a GATE blocking the way to Maku Tree grove
     6. Use B button (SWORD) to slash and open the gate - THIS IS CRITICAL!
     7. After gate opens: Press UP to enter the grove
     
     Visual landmarks:
     - Shop area: Building with items for sale
     - Vasu Jewelers: Eastern area of village
     - Gate: Barrier blocking grove entrance (must slash with sword)
     - Maku Tree grove: Large tree in peaceful garden area to the EAST
     
     KEY DIRECTIONAL RULE: From start ‚Üí Navigate EAST through village ‚Üí Continue EAST to grove entrance ‚Üí Slash gate with B ‚Üí Enter grove
  
  üìç OBJECTIVE 2: WAKE THE MAKU TREE (After entering grove)
     Inside the grove:
     1. Approach the Maku Tree (LARGE sleeping tree)
     2. The Maku Tree is ASLEEP - look for bubble from his nose
     3. Use B button (SWORD) to strike/pop the bubble - THIS WAKES HIM UP!
     4. After waking: Maku Tree gives you the GNARLED KEY
     5. Maku Tree explains quest (find 8 Essences of Nature)
     6. You now have the key to unlock Gnarled Root Dungeon!

     2. From screen north of village: Go EAST
     3. Then go NORTH (cut through bushes with B button as needed)
     4. Then go WEST across a bridge
     5. Look for a ROCK with a KEYHOLE
     6. Stand near rock and the Gnarled Key will automatically unlock it
     7. The Gnarled Root Dungeon (large dead tree structure) will RISE FROM GROUND!
     8. Press UP to enter the dungeon
     
     Visual landmarks:
