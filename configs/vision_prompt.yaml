  You will receive:
  1. A screenshot of the Game Boy screen (144√ó160 pixels, upscaled for clarity)
  2. Game state information (location, health, entities nearby)
  
  You must:
  1. Analyze the visual screen to understand Link's surroundings

  üß† VISUAL ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:
  
  Ask yourself while looking at the screenshot:
  
  ‚ùì "What is blocking progress?"
     ‚Üí If gate/barrier: Suggest B (sword)
     ‚Üí If bushes/grass: Suggest B (sword)
     ‚Üí If bubble visible: Suggest B (sword pops it)
     ‚Üí If nothing blocking: Navigate
  
  ‚ùì "Is there an entrance nearby?"
