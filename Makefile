# Unified Strategic Framework supporting:
# 1. Strategic Headless Training - Production training (train_headless_strategic.py)  
# 2. Strategic Visual Training   - Watch strategic training (train_visual_strategic.py)
# 3. Strategic Visual Inference  - Watch trained model play (run_inference.py + strategic)
#
# Strategic Framework Features:
# - Unified Strategic Training Framework (strategic_training_framework.py)
# - Strategic Action Translation (LLM commands ‚Üí game actions)
# - Strategic Reward System (5X LLM emphasis)
# - Strategic Environment Factory (proven configurations)
# - 55x-220x performance improvement vs random policy
# - Real-time strategic decision making via MLX Qwen2.5-14B
